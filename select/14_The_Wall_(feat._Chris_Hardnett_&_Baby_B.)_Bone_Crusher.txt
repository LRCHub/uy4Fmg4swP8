The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

[Incomprehensible] can't put the bread on the table
It isn't like she isn't willing and able
Went down to the department of labor
They gave her a job, makin't [Incomprehensible]
And it's like mental slavery

The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

Got love for my niggas, go to war for my niggas
My pistol keep caring and bugging for my niggas
Be strong for the struggle, hard for the struggle
Got to keep your hustle, you got to show your muscle

We down for the streets, we live in the streets
But fuck that trappin' nigga, but a nigga got to eat
You wanna bust your cap and life makes you snap
But hold on, nigga, you gots to adapt

The wall, wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

The wall, wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

And lift your head up, get your chin off your chest
Remember it's hard for us all, that's out here on the quest
To be the best at what we do and never accept the less
We all got our own destinies that we must manifest

You can't let 'em stop you and let 'em drop you
Sometimes a part of you just gotta do what you gotta
But you always keep swinging from my force
Don't you know I always [Incomprehensible]?

The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

The wall, the wall
And we keep on struggling
And we ain't got nothing
And we need to get something

(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
The wall, wall
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
And we keep on struggling
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)

And we ain't got nothing
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
And we need to get something
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)

The wall, wall
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
And we keep on struggling
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)

And we ain't got nothing
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
And we need to get something
(You gotta get up, stand up, never give up)
