There is some times
There is some nights
Also is life, trying to buy the night
Can't see

There is some trouble
Make me evolve
There is broke candles on my table
When I can't leave

There is some problem in my head
Depressed but I'm just desperate
And I can't feel

There is black dreams
Trembling my knees, punch my old dreams out
Anarchies and I can't think

And I know for certain that choosing groups are not my reach
And I will not slow down, that real life isn't so saintly
And we know best, walking too fast, behind the shadows of mind
And we know less close to the time, forever behind the wall

Building lifes' breeze blocks
Trembling my knees knock
Cold when the trees drop
Tumbling 'cause she's not, listening
The cold light is glistening
The white stars are christening
My thoughts, no-one's listening
I'm twisting them

Building lifes' breeze blocks
Trembling my knees knock
Cold when the trees drop
Tumbling 'cause she's not, listening
The cold light is glistening
The white stars are christening
My thoughts, no-one's listening
I'm twisting them (I'm twisting them)

There is a voice that tells me what's wrong
And all my awake, like the sun
And I can't hear

There is nobody to understand me
I stay stick to comfort, it would just be me
And I can't scream

There is no silence to describe pain
There is no mall-train, to escape
And I don't care, who I am

There is a cycle you can't make me run
There is nobody for wait my return
And I can't heal

And I know for certain that choosing groups are not my reach
And I will not slow down, that real life's isn't so saintly
And we know best, walking too fast, behind the shadow of mind
And we know less, lost in the time
Forever behind, the wall, the wall

Building lifes' breeze blocks
Trembling my knees knock
Cold when the trees drop
Tumbling 'cause she's not, listening
The cold light is glistening
The white stars are christening
My thoughts, no-one's listening
I'm twisting them

Into distorted images
The path that never finishes
All stains and blemishes
The soul self-punishes
Come in and take me further
My hunger verges on murder
Begins to bury the burden
To make themselves learn
And she yearns and she yearns them
