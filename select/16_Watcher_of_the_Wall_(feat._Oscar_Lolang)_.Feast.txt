The night is holding down the sun
It's darkest before dawn
I set my eyes on this wall that
Separates us all

This time now I know how
We're not the same after all

When friday calls all gather round
And mocking can be found
No responds made on sunday
Yet you here always sail

I recognize this wall
That separates us all
